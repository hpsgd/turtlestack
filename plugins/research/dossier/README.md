# Dossier

Build a single brand-styled PDF dossier from research outputs that conform to the report frontmatter contract. Three entry points:

- **`/dossier:consolidate`** — back end. Scan an engagement directory, group conforming reports by category, produce `DOSSIER.md` + `DOSSIER.pdf`. Use this when reports already exist (you ran individual skills or wrote them by hand).
- **`/dossier:executive-summary`** — fill the executive summary section interactively. Pick which reports feed in, name the audience and posture, sign off on an outline, review the draft before it's written. Offered automatically by consolidate; callable standalone to regenerate without re-running the whole dossier.
- **`/dossier:dossier`** (agent, drive mode) — front end. Name a target ("dossier on visualcare.com.au"), the agent asks what kind of investigation is wanted, dispatches the right skills with consistent arguments, then calls consolidate.

## What counts as a conforming report

Any markdown file inside the engagement directory whose YAML frontmatter declares all four required fields: `title`, `date`, `author`, `category`. See the `report-conventions.md` rule for the full contract.

The dossier doesn't care which plugin produced the file. Investigator outputs, analyst outputs, reports written by hand — all picked up if they conform. Files that don't conform are listed separately so the user can fix them or accept exclusion.

## Quick start — consolidate an existing engagement

```
/dossier:consolidate ~/Assessments/visualcare
```

The skill scans the directory, lists eligible files grouped by category, asks for any exclusions, then writes `DOSSIER.md` and renders `DOSSIER.pdf`.

## Quick start — drive a fresh campaign

Invoke the dossier agent and name a target. The agent walks you through:

1. What kind of target it is (domain, company, person, mixed)
2. Which engagement directory to use (default: `~/Assessments/<slug>/`)
3. Which categories to investigate (People, Corporate, Technical, Commercial, OSINT)
4. Which subjects under each category
5. Authorisation gate (if any People-category subjects)

It then dispatches skills, gathers outputs, and runs consolidate at the end.

## Engagement directory layout

```
~/Assessments/visualcare/
├── people-lookup/
│   ├── graves-michael.md
│   └── lau-susan.md
├── domain-intel/
│   └── visualcare-com-au.md
├── corporate-ownership/
│   └── visual-data-solutions-pty-ltd.md
├── DOSSIER.md           # produced by consolidate
└── DOSSIER.pdf          # rendered from DOSSIER.md
```

Each skill writes one file per invocation under `<engagement_dir>/<skill-name>/<subject-slug>.md`. The consolidate skill produces `DOSSIER.md` at the engagement root and renders the PDF alongside it.

## Dependencies

- **`/publishing:write-document-pdf`** — the renderer. If not installed, consolidate will produce the markdown but skip the PDF and tell you.
- **The `report-conventions.md` rule** — installed automatically when the dossier plugin is enabled (the rule also lives in `analyst` and `investigator`; any of those installs is sufficient).

## When not to use this

- You only need one report. Just run the relevant skill directly.
- The reports you want to consolidate don't conform to the report-conventions rule and you can't fix them. Either fix the producer (preferred) or write the dossier markdown by hand.
- You want a slim "synopsis-only" dossier. The current consolidate skill embeds full content. A separate skill would handle the slim case if there's demand.
